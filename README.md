# Spam Bot

This is a simple Python spam bot that sends a given message multiple times using the PyAutoGUI library.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.x)
- PyAutoGUI library (you can install it using `pip install pyautogui`)

## Usage

1. Run the `spam_bot.py` script.
2. Enter the message you want to spam when prompted.
3. Enter the number of times you want to send the message.
4. Set a countdown (in seconds, this gives you time to move the cursor to wherever you want to typewrite the spam messages)
5. Enter the delay between each message (in seconds).
6. The program will start spamming after the specified delay.

## Important Note

The program will start spamming after the specified delay, so make sure you have enough time to switch to the desired application before the spamming starts.
